# UBKG Concepts
This appendix is intended as a working glossary, and not as a formal or exhaustive terminology.
When the discussion of a term in the glossary refers to another term in the glossary, the other term will be in **_bold italic_**.

## Assertion
An assertion establishes a **_relationship_** between two **_entities_**.

## BioPortal
A repository of biomedical ontologies maintained by [NCBO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/). 

Although many of the ontologies published in BioPortal follow **_OBO principles_**, compliance is optional.

## Code
The identifier for a **_concept_** in a **_vocabulary_** or **_ontology_** in the UMLS. A code is unique to the ontology. For example, both the SNOMED_CT and the NCI Thesaurus vocabularies have different codes to represent the **_concept_** of “kidney”; however, because these codes are **_cross-referenced_** to the same UMLS concept, the codes share a CUI.
## Concept
An **_entity_** in the UBKG. A concept is represented with a **_code_** in a source ontology and a **_CUI_** in the overall UBKG.

## Concept Unique Identifier (CUI)
A unique identifier for a **_concept_** in the UBKG. A CUI can be cross-referenced by **_codes_** from many **_ontologies_**, allowing for associations between entities in different ontologies. 

For example, the CUI for the concept of _methanol_ in UMLS is cross-referenced by codes in a number of ontologies and vocabularies, such as SNOMED_CT and NCI. The use of the CUI allows for questions such as “How many different ways do all of the ontologies in the UBKG refer to methanol?” As the following illustration shows, a knowledge graph can reveal that terms from different ontologies include “methanol”, “Methyl Alcohol”, and “METHYL ALCOHOL”.

_How do all of the ontologies in the UBKG refer to “methanol”?_

## Cross-reference
A link between a **_concept_** in one **_ontology_** and a concept in another. Cross-references can be described in one of two ways:
- Between a **_code_** and a code in another ontology–e.g., HUBMAP C000007 (Imaging Assay) cross-references OBI 0000185 (Imaging Assay)
- Between a code and a UMLS **_CUI_**–e.g., HUBMAP C000007 (Assay) cross-references UMLS C1510438 (Assay)

Because UMLS CUIs can be linked to codes in many ontologies, a cross-reference to a UMLS CUIs is likely to be more useful than a cross-reference to a single code in another ontology.

## Edge
A synonym for a **_relationship_**, used primarily for **_knowledge graphs_**.

## Encode
To represent a **_concept_** in an **_ontology_** with a **_code**_. When possible, concepts should be encoded using codes from a standard, published source such as a vocabulary, a public database, or an **_OWL file_**. 

For example, in the Protein Ontology, the entity _5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1_ is encoded with code 000013225.

## Entity
An entity represents a member of an **_ontology_**. Entities associate with other entities in an ontology via **_relationships_**.

An example of an entity is _5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1_, which is a protein in the Protein Ontology (PR), **_encoded_** with **_code_** 000013225.

In a **_knowledge graph_**, an entity is represented by a **_node_**.

## Equivalence Class
A **_cross-reference_** between a **_concept_** in one **_ontology_** and a concept in another ontology. The idea of “equivalence class” is used in **_OWL_**.

## Ingest files
A set of files that describe the entities and relationships of an ontology that is to be integrated into the UBKG.

# Inverse relationship
A **_relationship_** in an **_ontology_** has a direction: it starts with one node and “goes toward” another–e.g., 

(_5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1_)→**isa**→(_protein_)

A relationship is considered the **inverse** of another relationship if it can be used to link the same nodes of the relationship in the opposite direction. For example, the _inverse_isa_ relationship for a concept can be used to identify those concepts that have a _isa_ relationship with the concept.

(_protein_)←**inverse_isa**←(_5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1_) 

Inverse relationships can be ambiguously named: for example, the inverse relationship of _has_gene_product_ is not _inverse_has_gene_product_, but _gene_product_of_. To obtain inverse relationships that are ambiguously named, the UBKG refers to the **_RO_**.

## IRI
In an **_OWL file_**, an **_entity_** or a **_relationship_** can be described with an **International Resource Indicator** (IRI). An IRI is a PURL (Permanent Uniform Resource Locator) that refers to a published online resource.

UBKG recognizes entity IRIs in format _OBO PURL_/_ontology identifier___code in ontology_.
For example, the IRI for a protein entity in PR is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_Q68D20.

UBKG recognizes relationship IRIs formatted in the same manner as for entities, provided that the OBO PURL is from the **_Relationship Ontology_** (RO)--e.g., http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002160.

## Knowledge Graph (database)
A knowledge graph is a representation of information characterized by the **_relationships_** between a set of **_entities_**. Whereas relational databases organize information into tables, rows, and fields, knowledge graph databases organize information into **_nodes_** (representing entities) and **_edges_** (representing relationships).

## NCBO
The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) maintains [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/), a repository of biomedical ontologies.

## neo4j
The UBKG database is deployed in instances of the [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph data platform. “A neo4j” or “the neo4j” is equivalent to “an instance of the UBKG database hosted in a neo4j server”.

## Node
A synonym for an **_entity_**, used primarily in **_knowledge graphs_**.

## Ontology
For the purposes of the UBKG, an ontology is the representation of a set of **_entities_** and the **_relationships_** between them. 

## OLS 
The Ontology Lookup Service [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) is a repository of biomedical **_ontologies_**. The OLS allows for searches of relationship properties (**_relationships_**), including those from the **_RO_**.

## OBO Foundry
The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry [OBO](https://obofoundry.org/) is a community that maintains a set of “interoperable ontologies for the biomedical sciences”, as well as a set of [principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html)–i.e., best practices and standards for representing ontologies in OWL.

Many of the ontologies published in BioPortal follow OBO principles.

## OWL files
The **Web Ontology Language** [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) is a language for representing **_ontologies_** in a standard format that can be interpreted by software applications. Biomedical ontologies can be published as OWL files in reference sites such as the **_NCBO BioPortal_** and the **_OBO Foundry_**.

## Relationship
A relationship is an association between two **_entities_** in an **_ontology_**.

### Types of relationships
Most of the relationships in biomedical ontologies can be characterized with one of two types:
- _hierarchical_ (e.g., _5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1_ **isa** _protein_)
- _non-hierarchical_ (e.g., _protein PMS2CL (human)_ **gene_product_of** _PMS2CL gene_)

In a **_knowledge graph_**, a relationship corresponds to an **_edge_** between two **_nodes_**.

## Relationship Ontology (RO)
The Relationship Ontology (RO) is an **_ontology_** of the **_relationships_** that are used in other ontologies–i.e., how relationships themselves relate to one another. 

A relationship between relationships that is important in the UBKG is the **_inverse relationship_**. 

Relationships in RO can be reviewed in a number of ways, including:
- By searching the **_OLS_**
- [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oborel/obo-relations/master/ro.json)

## SAB
The UBKG adopts the UMLS practice of identifying source ontologies with a **Source Abbreviation** (SAB). Examples of UMLS SABs include SNOMED_CT and UBERON. UBKG uses published acronyms for ontologies when possible–e.g., PATO.

## Term: preferred term, synonym
A usually short text identifier for a **_code_** in an **_ontology**_. For example, a term for code 64033007 in SNOMED_CT is “kidney”.

A term can be a _preferred term_ or a _synonym_.

## Triple
A triple **_asserts_** a **_relationship**_ between two **_entities_** (nodes) in an **_ontology_**.

A triple is in the format
_subject_ _predicate_	_object_

_subject_ and _object_ are both entities (nodes). _predicate_ is a relationship (edge).

## Vocabulary
For the purposes of the UBKG, a vocabulary is similar to an **_ontology_**. Some vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED_CT) are also ontologies.

## UMLS
The Unified Medical Language System [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html) consolidates a number of different biomedical **_ontologies_**, **_vocabularies_**, and standards. 

The UBKG represents UMLS and other concept data with a set of **_nodes_** and **_edges_**, including nodes for 
- the **_code_** for the concept in its originating ontology
- the **_CUI_** for the code in the UBKG
- **_terms_** for the concept, both for preferred terms and synonyms
- definitions of the concept
