# User Guide
## Adding assertions to a Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG)

# Objectives
This guide describes how to format assertions as an ontology so that the ontology can be added to the Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph database. The guide includes recommendations for optimizing and deepening the integration of an ontology into the UBKG to establish new relationships among entities and cross-references among ontologies.

# Audience
This guide is intended for users who are subject matter experts in what biomedical assertions they might want to represent (e.g., genes and their products), as an ontology, but not necessarily conversant with either ontological concepts or knowledge graphs.

# Glossary
The [glossary](/user-guide/glossary) describes terms that this guide uses that are relevant to ontologies or knowledge graphs. 

# Guiding Principles for Integration
An important goal of the UBKG is to establish connections between ontologies. For example,if information on the relationships between proteins and genes described in one ontology can be connected to information on the relationships between genes and diseases described in another ontology, it may be possible to identify previously unknown relationships between proteins and diseases.

If the UBKG is to connect ontologies, the ontologies should, as much as possible, represent their entities and relationships similarly. **_To the degree possible_**,
1. Entities should be encoded with codes from published biomedical ontologies and vocabularies. For example, genes should be encoded in a standard vocabulary such as HGNC.
2. Relationships should be represented with properties from the Relationship Ontology.
3. Codes for entities should be cross-referenced to UMLS CUIs.

# Integration Options
An ontology can be integrated into the UBKG from one of the following sources:
1. An OWL file that follows OBO principles. If the OWL file is published online, only the URL to the OWL is needed.
2. A set of UBKG ingest files. 

The ingestion of content of OWL files is straightforward. The rest of this guide focuses on ingest files.

# Ingest Files: Format and Content
A set of UBKG ingest files describes the entities and relationships of an ontology that is to be integrated into the UBKG. 

An ingest file set consists of two Tab-Separated Variables (TSV) files:

- **edges.tsv**: Describes the triples comprising the ontology
- **nodes.tsv**: Describes metadata for entities

## Source Abbreviations (SABs) 
The UBKG identifies a set of assertions by means of a _Source Abbreviation_ (SAB). SABs often correspond to abbreviations for ontologies (e.g., PATO) or vocabularies (e.g., ICD-10). 

For new sets of assertions, define a preferred SAB to represent the initiative, project, or institution.

SABs are uppercase in the UBKG. 

## edges.tsv
The edges file lists the _triples_ (subject node - predicate - object node) that constitute a set of assertions.

###  Fields

subject|**Code** node|IRI for a concept in a published ontology|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004086

 | | |Custom string | drinks milkshake of
 object|**Code** node|same as for subject
 evidence_class (_optional_)|**string**|Statement specific to an SAB to classify evidence|-0.016084092
 
 ###  Recommendations for nodes
 
Many nodes will correspond to entities that have already been identified in a standard biomedical ontology; for these, the IRI is preferred. 
For entities that have not been encoded in an ontology, a suitable identifier is sufficient.

For example, the UBKG includes information relating genes and gene products obtained from UniProtKB. Proteins are identified using their UniProtKB Entry ID, instead of an IRI.

###  Recommendations for edges
The preferred source of relationship (predicate) information is the Relations Ontology (RO). Reasons for this include:
1. RO is a general reference for relationships, and is therefore likely already to have a standard relationship defined that is suitable.
2. RO defines inverse relationships, especially those that may not be obvious.

It is possible, nevertheless, that RO does not contain a relationship that is specific enough for an assertion, so a custom relationship will be needed. When defining a custom relationship, we recommend that the label be short and consise. (We realize that this is easier said than done. Defining consise relationships is the hard part of modelling assertions.)

## nodes.tsv
 The nodes.tsv file provides metadata on entities.

### Fields

# Requirements (business rules) for nodes and relationships
1. A node identified in edges.tsv must satisfy **at least one** of the following criteria:
- It is defined in nodes.tsv.
- It already exists in the UBKG.

The UBKG will not ingest nodes that do not satisfy at least one of the criteria.

2. If a triple in edges.tsv refers to a node from a non-UMLS ontology, the non-UMLS ontology will need to be ingested into the UBKG first. For example, because the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) includes nodes from the Cell Ontology (CL), CL should be integrated into the UBKG before MP. This often improves the cross-referencing because the general ontologies have deeper external-referencing to UMLS and other OBO sources.

3. [This spreadsheet](https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/UBKG/blob/main/user%20guide/ontology%20neo4j%20SABs%20and%20sample%20codes%20-%20ontology%20neo4j%20SABs%20and%20sample%20codes.csv) lists the SABs and example codes for the ontologies that are currently represented in the UBKG. It should be used as the reference for formatting existing source abbreviations (SAB) and their codes. In other words, if a SAB is already part of the UBKG, it should be sufficient to refer to the node by code. 

For additional details regarding the UMLS SABs, please consult [the UMLS reference](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html).

4. Some ontologies (including HGNC, GO, and HPC) include the SAB in codes (e.g., HGNC:9999) Nodes for concepts from these ontologies should be formatted as <SAB><space><SAB>: code-e.g., “HGNC HGNC:9999”.
5. The UBKG ingestion will reformat predicates so that strings are delimited with underscores.
6. The UBKG ultimately requires that two nodes be linked with both a relationship and its inverse. However, in an edges file each relationship (predicate) should be represented only once (NOT with the original and inverse). The UBKG identifies and adds the inverse relationships using the RO as follows:

predicate|form of inverse relationship|comment
---|---|---
IRI of relationship property in RO|Resolution via RO, using the IRI
String that corresponds to the relation label (e.g., “has gene product”)|Resolution via RO, using relationship labels|not as precise as IRI
Custom string|Appends “inverse_” to the string |If the custom string actually corresponds to a relationship in RO with an ambiguous inverse, UBKG will create a new inverse relationship.
IRI of relationship property from ontology other than RO|none|The UBKG will ignore these relationships.

# Best Practices for cross-references 
The items in the **_node_dbxref_** field of **nodes.tsv** establish cross-references. The degree to which an ontology integrates with the UBKG depends directly on cross-references: an ontology with nodes that cross-reference nodes in other ontologies are more likely to contribute to new relationships, while an ontology with few cross-references will essentially exist independently of the rest of the UBKG.

A good rule of thumb for cross-references is: _the closer to a UMLS CUI, the better_.

The UBKG ingestion preferentially selects UMLS CUIs from the list in node_dbxref. 
It is not necessary to list both a UMLS CUI and a code from an ontology that is already in the UMLS. 
If it is not feasible to cross-reference a UMLS CUI, then try to cross-reference a code from a published, OBO-compliant ontology.

A cross-reference is not the same thing as an isa relationship.
