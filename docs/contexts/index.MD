# Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG) 
# Source Contexts

---

The **source context** for an instance of the UBKG (or **UBKG context**) describes a collection of sets of assertions, each of which is identified by SAB.

A SAB can correspond to one of the following types of sets of assertions:
1. **Ontology** data, such as that extracted from OWL files published in sources such as the NCBO BioPortal or the OBO Foundry.
2. **Reference** data extracted from public sources such as UniProtKB.
3. **Result** Summarized experimental result data obtained from entities such as NIH-supported laboratories.


### UMLS source context (UMLS-Graph)
The UMLS context includes sets of assertions obtained from [over 100 vocabularies](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html) organized by the UMLS, including
- SNOMEDCT_US
- ICD10
- LOINC
- HGNC

All of these assertions are considered as being from ontologies.

#### CodeID standardization

In the UBKG, the colon is a reserved character, used to delimit SAB from code in a CodeID property of a Code node.

A small number of  vocabularies from the UMLS have default code formats that either include the name of the vocabulary 
in the code or contain a colon. These vocabularies and their formats include:

| SAB                 | default format             |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| HGNC                | HGNC HGNC:x                |
| GO                  | GO GO:x                    |
| HPO                 | HPO HP:x                   |
| HCPCS (Level codes) | HCPCS Level n: Exxx-E-xxxx |

Executing the generation script with the SAB argument of UMLS reformats codes from
the UMLS to the format SAB:CODE. HPO codes are standardized to **HP** as the SAB.

### non-UMLS Source Platforms
Sources of data for the UBKG (other than the UMLS base) include:

1. [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/)
2. [NCBO BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)
3. Sites maintained by stewards, including GitHub repositories, FTP sites, etc.
4. Globus (for sources specific to Data Distillery)
5. Spreadsheets in the custom _**SimpleKnowledge Editor**_ format, stored in Google Drive
6. Custom ETL scripts


### UBKG base context (UMLS plus)
The UBKG base context appends to the UMLS context assertions from a number of other standard biomedical ontologies and data sources. 
The UBKG base context includes assertions from the following SABs:

| SAB                                                        | Description                                            | Type of data | platform                                 |

#### RefSeq gene summaries
The base context includes summaries of genes from [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/).
A separate script adds RefSeq summaries to the UBKG. This import assumes that GenCode has been ingested.

### Azimuth-Cell Ontology mappings
The HuBMAP project is building a mapping between tissue codings from Azimuth and Cell Ontology (CL).
The AZ-CL mappings will be added to UBKG contexts as needed.

SABs include:
