# ubkg-docs
[Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG) Documentation](https://ubkg.docs.xconsortia.org/)

## Usage
- Save your documentation files in the `docs/` directory.
- Properly name the documents and directories as path names are used to automatically generate the `Breadcrumbs`
- Properly use H headings, in their correct rankings as these are pulled from the documents to automatically generate the `Table of Contents`
- For convenience, within `docs/lang/en.json`, you are free to change the text:  
  - And links of the `menu` property without having to rebuild the html files. The `menu` property is an array of objects in format of `{name: "Link name", href: "/link-url"}`
  - Of the `breadcrumbRoot` property without having to rebuild the html files. The change here will appear on the `Breadcrumbs` component. If you remove this property, no root will be included.

## Contents
- `/src/`- Any source code used to generate the hosted documents (not directly published)
- `/docs/` - Contains the markdown files that are hosted as html by GitHub Pages.
- `/docker/` - The files to create a docker image which can be run locally to test the site. This image is built and available from DockerHub as `hubmap/github-pages-server`


## Development
### Install 
```bash
cd documentation
npm i .
```

### Run Dev Server
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) with your browser to see the result.   
*Note:* This is only for viewing the styles, layouts and JS functionality generated through `/src` changes, ideally should set up the docker server for mimicking of GitHub pages to test fully.

### CSS 
```
npm run css # builds CSS files to `/docs/css/main.css` and copies to `./docs/_site` GitHub build folder
```

### JS
```
npm run js # builds Js files to `/docs/js/main.js` and copies to `./docs/_site` GitHub build folder
```

### html
```
npm run html # builds the PUG layout and pages to `/docs[/_layouts]`
```

### Build All 
```
npm run build # builds all of the above
```
Serve `docs` folder locally.   
Should have `serve` module installed after running `npm i .`

## Coding Conventions
- Do use dash casing to separate words for directories in `docs`:
  - correct: `foo-who/` , incorrect: `foo_who/`
- Please set up prettier in your IDE to keep code formatting consistent or just follow the prettier rules as described in `./package.json`
- Do follow any additional code formatting and styles as seen in the project

## Mimicking GitHub Pages Locally
The docker image built out of the `/docker` directory provides a local server to mimic the GitHub Pages server. This image has been built and pushed to DockerHub. 
To run it you must mount a local copy of the `/documentation/` repo as a volume in the container as the volume `/software-docs/` and expose port `4000` locally. 
The `runlocal.sh` script is provided to help with this. You must have docker installed and running.

To test this repository locally using the docker image execute the `runlocal.sh` script included in this directory like:

`sh ./runlocal.sh /full/absolute/path/to/the/downloaded/repository`
When the container is running correctly you'll be able to navigate to https://localhost:4000/ in a local browser.
